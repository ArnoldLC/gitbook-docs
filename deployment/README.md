# Deployment

Once you have your application working and ready to be deployed you can create a production version by doing (from the root of your project)

```
npx frontity build
```

This command will generate a `build` folder containing both your (isomorphic) React app and your Frontity (node) server 

So, this folder can be deployed to any hosting that is prepared to serve a node app

The content of this `build` folder will be used by the command

```
npx frontity serve
```

which we can be used to launch our Frontity app in production
