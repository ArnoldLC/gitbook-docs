If you are coming to Frontity from a different background, perhaps from the WordPress/PHP world, then there are some concepts that you will need to understand first. In order to start using Frontity you will need to know some of the basic concepts of JavaScript and React. 

We have provided the following guides to help get you started if these areas are new to you.

* [Javascript](javascript-basics.md)
* [React](react-basic.md)

{% hint style="info" %}
We are planning to add more guides on other important topics such as the Command Line and NPM. If you have suggestions or ideas for other guides then drop us a line on [our community forum](https://community.frontity.org/c/docs-and-tutorials).
