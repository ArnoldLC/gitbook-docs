# Deploy Frontity on Now

According to Zeit: _"[Now](https://zeit.co/now) is a global deployment network built on top of all existing cloud providers. It makes teams productive by removing servers and configuration, makes serverless application deployment easy."_

We strongly recommend this service as it is serverless, cheap, includes CDN, and really easy to set up. _It also supports the cache technique stale-while-revalidate (they name it [Serverless Pre-Rendering](https://zeit.co/blog/serverless-pre-rendering)), a powerful way to improve your website speed.

To be able to deploy with now you need to have a Now account. You can [signup here](https://zeit.co/signup).

Once you have an account you have to login from the terminal 

```text
> npx now login
```
---


These are the instructions to deploy a Frontity project on Now, once you are ready to deploy your project:

### Create a [`now.json`](https://zeit.co/docs/configuration?query=now.json#introduction/configuration-reference)

1. Create this `now.json` file and save it in the r oot your Frontity project.

```text
{
  "version": 2,
  "builds": [
    {
      "src": "package.json",
      "use": "@frontity/now"
    }
  ]
}
```


### Deploy

Deploy Frontity using this command (from the root of your project):

```text
> npx now
```

You should get something like this

```
? Set up and deploy “~/PROJECTS/2020/FRONTITY/DEMOS/my-frontity-project”? [Y/n] y
? Which scope do you want to deploy to? myZeitScope
? Link to existing project? [y/N] n
? What’s your project’s name? my-frontity-project
? In which directory is your code located? my-frontity-project/
🔗  Linked to zeit-username/my-frontity-project (created .now and added it to .gitignore)
🔍  Inspect: https://zeit.co/zeit-username/my-frontity-project/9ue4zsq9n [26s]
✅  Production: https://my-frontity-project.now.sh [copied to clipboard] [1m]
📝  Deployed to production. Run `now --prod` to overwrite later (https://zeit.ink/2F).
💡  To change the domain or build command, go to https://zeit.co/zeit-username/my-frontity-project/settings
```

*Now* will assign you a domain (something like *your-project-name.now.sh*) that that will allow you to check your site online

From this deploy example we have got the following URL's:

- **Live URL** (https://my-frontity-project.now.sh) → Our temporary URL assigned automatically by Now, We can check (and share) our site online from this URL 
- **Inspect** (https://zeit.co/zeit-username/my-frontity-project/settings) → Here we can check the status of our site and check the logs among other things
- **Project Settings** (https://zeit.co/zeit-username/my-frontity-project/settings) → Here we can change domain and build settings among other things

## Deploy your site under a custom domain

To deploy your site under a custom domain you have to

- configure your Frontity app to point to that custom domain 
- configure your custom domain for your project in the ZEIT settings
- add ZEIT nameservers for your custom domain from your domain provider 

...before deploying it

### Add your custom domain in your project settings

From the project settings URL provided in our previous deploy (https://zeit.co/zeit-username/my-frontity-project/settings in our example) we can set a custom domain 
![](../.gitbook/assets/now-projects-settings.png)

Add it, and you will be provided by a set a nameservers you can use in your domain provider to point your custom domain to the ZEIT nameservers


```
a.zeit-world.co.uk
c.zeit-world.org
d.zeit-world.net
e.zeit-world.com
```

### Add ZEIT nameservers in your domain provider

You need to set [ZEIT nameservers](https://zeit.co/docs/v2/custom-domains/#option-2:-using-external-nameservers) as custom DNS of your custom domain from your domain provider site

{% hint style="info" %}
If you don't know how to do this, contact your domain provider (GoDaddy, CloudFlare, etc)
{% endhint %}

### Deploy

Then, deploy Frontity using this command (from the root of your project):

```text
> npx now --prod
```

You should get something like this

```
⬢  my-frontity-project  npx now --prod

🔍  Inspect: https://zeit.co/zeit-username/my-frontity-project/9ue4zsq9n [2s]
✅  Production: https://mycustomtomain.com [copied to clipboard] [4s]

This will create a deploy and assign it to your real site url.
