# ðŸŽ¨ Frontity Themes

With Frontity, you can build your own theme from scratch matching all your needs or use a ready-to-use one, which will make it much easier. You can even install a starter theme and keep working on top of that. Basically it's the same as WordPress, just keep working as you usually do.
