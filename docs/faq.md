### What is Frontity?

Frontity is a free and open source framework for creating WordPress themes based on React JS. In other words, it allows to build a **React frontend** for a **headless WordPress** site, which serves its data via the WordPress **REST API**.

Combining WordPress and React has plenty of advantages, but there are a lot of things that developers need to learn and configure. Unlike other React frameworks that can work with WordPress, Frontity is an **opinionated** framework 100% focused on this CMS, which makes **everything much easier** \(even for those developers who are less familiar with React\) and optimized to be used with WordPress.

### How can I get started?

It is really easy to start using Frontity, you just have to make sure you have Node installed and follow [this quick start guide](getting-started/quick-start-guide.md).‚ö°Ô∏è

### Do I need any specific knowledge or skills to use Frontity?

You need to know how to use WordPress for your content management and some React knowledge for designing your frontend. The rest is already wired up for you: React, Webpack, Babel, SSR, Routing, CSS-in-JS, WP REST API, TypeScript, Linting, Testing‚Ä¶ This way, you can focus on building your website. üöÄ

### Can I use Frontity with WordPress.com?
